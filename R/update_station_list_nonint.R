#' Download Latest Station List Metadata and Update an Internal Database
#'
#' This function downloads the latest station list (isd-history.csv) from the
#' \acronym{NCEI} server and updates the data distributed with \CRANpkg{GSODR}
#' to the latest stations available.  These data provide unique identifiers,
#' country, state (if in U.S.) and when weather observations begin and end.
#'
#' Care should be taken when using this function if reproducibility is necessary
#' as different machines with the same version of \CRANpkg{GSODR} can end up
#' with different versions of the 'isd_history.csv' file internally.
#'
#' There is no need to use this unless you know that a station exists in the
#' isd_history.csv file that is not available in the self-contained
#' database distributed with \CRANpkg{GSODR}.
#'
#' To directly access these data, use: \cr
#' \code{load(system.file("extdata", "isd_history.rda", package = "GSODR"))}
