Focusing on the fire-prone Cape Floristic Region of South Africa—a biodiversity hotspot—our system combines satellite data, field observations, and modeling to track changes in vegetation, identify threats like fires or invasive species, and support better conservation decisions. In partnership with the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), EMMA aims to provide reliable, up-to-date information that helps protect these critical landscapes.\n\n\nRegional Overview\n\nprotected_areas_monthly_delta_ndvi &lt;- extract(monthly_delta_ndvi_raster,protected_areas,fun=quantile,na.rm=T) |&gt; \n  as_tibble() |&gt; \n  select(-1) |&gt; #drop the index\n  rename(\"Q0\"=\"NDVI\",\"Q25\"=\"NDVI.1\",\"Q50\"=\"NDVI.2\",\"Q75\"=\"NDVI.3\",\"Q100\"=\"NDVI.4\") |&gt; \n  bind_cols(name=protected_areas$name)\n\n\nprotected_areas_monthly_delta_ndvi |&gt; \n  #gather(quantile,value,-name) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(xmin=Q25,xmax=Q75,x=Q50,y=name))+\n    geom_errorbarh()\n\nWarning: Removed 6 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_errorbarh()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyears_since_fire &lt;- extract(years_since_fire_raster,protected_areas,fun=quantile,na.rm=T) |&gt; \n  as_tibble() |&gt; \n  select(-1) |&gt; #drop the index\n  rename(\"Q0\"=\"lyr.1\",\"Q25\"=\"lyr.1.1\",\"Q50\"=\"lyr.1.2\",\"Q75\"=\"lyr.1.3\",\"Q100\"=\"lyr.1.4\") |&gt; \n  bind_cols(name=protected_areas$name)\n\n\n\nStand Age distributions\n\nyears_since_fire |&gt; \n  mutate(name = fct_reorder(as.factor(name), Q50)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Q50)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(y=name))+\n    geom_segment(aes(x=Q0,xend=Q100),col=grey(.7))+\n    geom_segment(aes(x=Q25,xend=Q75),col=grey(.4))+\n    geom_point(aes(x=Q50))\n\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.\nℹ In argument: `name = fct_reorder(as.factor(name), Q50)`.\nCaused by warning:\n! `fct_reorder()` removing 11 missing values.\nℹ Use `.na_rm = TRUE` to silence this message.\nℹ Use `.na_rm = FALSE` to preserve NAs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyears_since_fire |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(Q50)) |&gt; \n  mutate(name = fct_reorder(as.factor(name), Q50)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(y = name)) +\n    # Full range (min to max)\n    geom_segment(aes(x = Q0, xend = Q100, yend = name), color = \"grey70\", size = .5) +\n    # Interquartile range (Q25 to Q75)\n    geom_segment(aes(x = Q25, xend = Q75, yend = name), color = \"grey40\", size = 1) +\n    # Median point\n    geom_point(aes(x = Q50), size = 2, color = \"black\") +\n    labs(\n      x = \"Years Since Fire\",\n      y = NULL,\n      title = \"Distribution of Time Since Fire by Site\",\n      subtitle = \"Showing full range (Q0–Q100), IQR (Q25–Q75), and median (Q50)\"\n    ) \n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage last updated at 2025-05-13 13:10:20.436536."

    "text": "Ecosystems provide essential goods and services, and maintaining their health is of crucial importance to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Shrubland ecosystems, where trees may be present but not dominant, make up &gt;40% of the global total ecosystem organic carbon and contain a substantial proportion of the world’s biological diversity. Advances in Earth Observation, in situ measurements, and ecological models allow the development of near real-time monitoring tools that report on the state and changes in vegetation, the ecosystem functions, processes and services they drive, and the pressures they face. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no operational tools of this nature exist for dynamic shrubland ecosystems that are prone to fire and other natural disturbances, short-term (event-driven) variability, and long-term trends. This project is developing an operational system and tools for monitoring the vegetation state of a fire-prone shrubland ecosystem. Our study region is the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, which contains 20% of Africa’s plant diversity and is a Global Biodiversity Hotspot and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Our main end-user organization is the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), which will further facilitate the adoption of our developed tools by other government departments and conservation organizations in the region. The indigenous vegetation in the study region is threatened by climate change, human-induced habitat loss, and invasion by alien species. Due to a lack of readily available, reliable, and up-to-date information on the state of the ecosystem, our end users face challenging decisions about where to allocate extremely limited human and other resources for the management and conservation of protected areas. This project combines Earth observations (e.g., NDVI and fire data from MODIS), in situ observations, and ecological forecasting models to characterize the spatial and temporal variation of the vegetation state (including structure, productivity, natural disturbance dynamics, and seasonal phenology) for near real-time monitoring and change detection in the study region. We will produce an operational system and tools which leverage iterative ecological forecasting and deep learning to predict natural land surface processes, evaluate near-real-time changes in the vegetation state, and classify the factors causing abnormal vegetation changes. Once completed, the system and tools will support the decisions of our end users by providing various types of near real-time information, such as unmapped fires, locations where vegetation has been damaged or cleared, areas where alien plant species are invading indigenous vegetation, and the locations where high plant mortality has occurred. The system and tools will be deployed on SAEON’s computational infrastructure for operational forecasts and monitoring. Our developed system and tools are readily extensible to similar ecosystems (e.g., the Californian Chaparral, Australian Kwongan, and parts of the Mediterranean Basin), and can be adapted to ecosystems with different dynamics.\nEMMA is a project supported by a NASA grant #80NSSC21K1183 Near-Real-Time Forecasting and Change Detection for a Fire-Prone Shrubland Ecosystem\n\n\nOur primary end-user is the South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON), where Co-Is Slingsby and Moncrieff work as scientists. This project will help SAEON develop and share long term ecological research data and decision-relevant information for natural resource management and environmental protection policy-making under several mandates: 1) informing protected area managers of ecosystem changes (GEO Global Ecosystem Initiative); 2) reporting on changes in biodiversity at national and international levels through South Africa’s National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) and the CBD Aichi Biodiversity Targets (and post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework); 3) informing the “red listing” of threatened ecosystems (iucnrle.org), which further informs conservation priorities and environmental authorizations in South Africa (NEMA Act 107 of 1998, NEMBA Act 10 of 2004); and 4) identifying areas of established and nascent alien plant invasions. The developed system will help SAEON provide more comprehensive and accurate information for its stakeholders, such as South African National Parks, CapeNature, World Wildlife Fund, and The Nature Conservancy, to improve decisions related to the monitoring and management of protected areas in the region, while also providing a long-term record of ecological change for research purposes.\n\n\n\n\nJasper Slingsby, co-I\nGlenn Moncrieff, co-I\nYingjie Hu, co-I\nAdam M. Wilson, PI\n\n\n\n\nOn September 9, 2021, we held a virtual workshop at the Fynbos Forum (https://fynbosforum2020.co.za/workshop-03/), an annual meeting of scientists and managers entitled Satellite monitoring of the Fynbos biome: identifying user needs. The workshop was attended by about 80 participants from a variety of organizations across South Africa including the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Nelson Mandela University, SAEON, Botanical Society of South Africa, SANBI, SANParks, CapeNature, The Nature Conservancy, DEA&DP Biodiversity Management, and the University of Stellenbosch. At this meeting, the participants selected to join one or more of the following working groups: fire management, monitoring species and ecosystems, invasive species management, hydrology, and illegal vegetation clearing. We then presented the initial ideas of the project and co-designed a set of potential applications/decisions that could be enhanced. Many people within this group offered to provide feedback on the prototype system during development."

    "text": "The details are given in [@slingsby_near-real_2020;@wilson_climatic_2015], but in short what we do is estimate the age of a site by calculating the years since the last fire. We then fit a curve to model the recovery of vegetation (measured using NDVI) as a function of it’s age. For this we use a negative exponential curve with the following form:\n\\[\\mu_{i,t}=\\alpha_i+\\gamma_i\\Big(1-e^{-\\frac{age_{i,t}}{\\lambda_i}}\\Big)\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu_{i,t}\\) is the expected NDVI for site \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\)\nThe observed greenness \\(NDVI_{i,t}\\) is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu_{i,t}\\) \\[NDVI_{i,t}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{i,t},\\sigma_)\\]\nAn additional level models the parameters of the negative exponential curve as a function of environmental variables. This means that sites with similar environmental conditions should have similar recovery curves. The full model also includes a sinusoidal term to capture seasonal variation, but lets keep it simple here."

    "text": "NDVI and Time Since Fire\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Leaflet map showing delta NDVI, NDVI, number of years since the most recent fire, and recent invasive species records. NA values in the delta NDVI and NDVI layers indicate missing data (e.g. due to clouds, water, etc.). Delta NDVI is the difference between observed NDVI and expected NDVI (i.e., the long-term mean). Monthly delta NDVI is calculated relative to the mean NDVI of the current month across the MODIS record while long-term delta NDVI is calculated relative the mean NDVI across the entire MODIS record. NA values in the delta NDVI layer indicate missing data (e.g. due to clouds, water, etc.). NDVI data are from 2025-01-17. NA values in the fire layer indicate that no fires have been recorded for that area. Note that the color scale for fires has been truncated, and any sites with more than 20 years since fire appear as 20. The number of years since fire can be seen by hovering your cursor over the polygon of interest. Vegetation age polygons for the park are available at: #r park_fires_file. A raster layer of vegetation age (years since fire) is available at https://github.com/AdamWilsonLab/emma_report/releases/download/current/years_since_fire.tif .The mean current NDVI layer is available at https://github.com/AdamWilsonLab/emma_envdata/releases/download/current/mean_ndvi.tif ."
